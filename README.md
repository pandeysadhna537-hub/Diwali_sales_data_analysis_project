# Diwali_sales_data_analysis_project
This is my first project
This project analyzes Diwali sales data retrieved from a CSV file. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook with Python. The dataset contains information about sales during the Diwali period, and the analysis aims to explore patterns, trends, and insights from this data.
